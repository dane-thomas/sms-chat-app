# Chat App

This is a chat app built using the MEAN stack

## What it does

This app allows a user to send sms messages from a twilio number and receive replies to that number back in the chat

## Things left to do

- Password reset
- Some styling that needs to be looked into
- Improve socket usage to update the most recent message preview in message bar
- Needs a lot of tests
